	<h2>Why You Should Clone You GetHub Repository At Creation</h2>
	<br />
	<p>The reason I named this repository s2w-git-test is because when I made the first repo, which I named text, I never cloned it. If I would have cloned it when I made it, it would have been easier to synchronized, and I wouldn't have hade to waste about 4 hours trying to get test to pull.</p>
	<br />
	<p>You see, when I tried synchronising, or if you perfer pulling my repository, under the name test, I kept getting a rejection error. I'm sure it's the same error that you keep gitting, You know that ![rejected] master -> master (fetch first) error. Right?</p>
	<br />
	<p>So, I wanted to let you know that I found the solution, after hours of searching through YouTube and a lot of documntations. I'll tell you it took a lot patiences. To you a big CONGRATULATIONS,if you made it this far.</p> 
	<br />
	<p>One of these days you're gonna be a star. I see you on the golf course swinging way under par. Got yourself another hole-in-one! I bet you thank the Holy One.</p>
	<br />
	<p>There you are in the ballpark and your're at the plate. You got your eyes on the prise, but the picther thinks you're looking him right in the face. Here comes the picth, it's a inside fast ball. Just the way you like them, Nice.</p>
	<br />
	<p>You swing, and timed it right. CLOCK~ it's going, it going, and its out of the box. I'm going to help you knock them right out of their socks.</p> 
	<br />
	<p>Its forth down, and only inchs before your next touchdown. The other team thinks it's going to be another quarter-back sneak. OK, we go on three. Over the top you go. Now, that was sweet. You never even touched the ground.</p>
	<br />
	<p>I'm going to make sure you make it to the next round. You're going for the KO before the bell sounds.</p>
	<br />
	<p>I've got the answer to the Git rejection, that put you all in this situration. I've broken it down in steps so there'll be no mis-interpertation. I took it and placed it in practice project number 8, So, lets go and celebrate.</p>
